Gitpod is frictionless coding.

Whether you just want to hack, have code to review or feel like trying something new on GitLab, GitHub, or Bitbucket, Gitpod launches a prebuilt dev environment with a single click.

Because Gitpod is based on open-source tech like VS Code, Docker, and Kubernetes, it is familiar, comprehensive, extensible, and easy to use. With deep code-hosting platform integrations, tools for sharing and collaborating, and a focus on usability, Gitpod contains your entire dev workflow in a browser tab.
