title: Scaling Kubernetes Resources with InfluxDB & Flux
youtubeId: CkSFrn_qYws
---

This video is a demonstration of using Zalando's Metrics Adapter and custom metrics to initiative scaling through annotations on the HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) resource. The annotations contain a Flux query that allows fetching metrics from InfluxDB to determine if a resource should be scaled.
