🔨 About the Technologies

Kaniko

kaniko is a tool to build container images from a Dockerfile, inside a container or Kubernetes cluster.
kaniko doesn't depend on a Docker daemon and executes each command 
within a Dockerfile completely in userspace.
This enables building container images in environments that can't easily
 or securely run a Docker daemon, such as a standard Kubernetes cluster.
kaniko is meant to be run as an image: gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor. We do not recommend running the kaniko executor binary in another image, as it might not work.
