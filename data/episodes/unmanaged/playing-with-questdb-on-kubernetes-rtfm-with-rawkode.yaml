In this episode, I am joined by my friend and former colleague, David Simmons; whom is currently the Head of Developer Relations for QuestDB. We deploy QuestDB to Kubernetes, using the Helm Chart I built, and kick the tyres a little as David introduces me to the cool features of QuestDB.

🕰.   Timeline

00:00 - Holding screen
01:55 - Introductions
04:00 - Going over the Helm Chart
08:45 - I finally got it installed after realising I was in the wrong directory
09:25 - Playing with the QuestDB UI
12:00 - Installing and configuring Telegraf to write to QuestDB with the TCP/UDP socket writer
14:45 - Playing with the QuestDB query language
27:00 - Querying billions of records in milliseconds with try.questdb.io PUBLIC dataset 🤯
44:00 - Chat and finish
