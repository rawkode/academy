youtubeId: gJCumFZQt1M
---

In this episode, joined by my colleague Dan Finneran, we take a practical look at one of his open source projects, Plunder, and get hands on with the kube-vip component.

Plunder is a single-binary server that is all designed in order to make the provisioning of servers, platforms and applications easier. It is deployed as a server that an end user can interact with through it's Api-server in order to control and automate the usage. 

kube-vip is a Kubernetes Virtual IP and Load-Balancer for the Kubernetes control pane and services. It is a small self-contained and highly available option for bare metal and edge (Arm, embedded, and/or IoT) environments.
