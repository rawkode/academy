OpenEBS builds on Kubernetes to enable Stateful applications to easily access Dynamic Local PVs or Replicated PVs. By using the Container Attached Storage pattern users report lower costs, easier management, and more control for their teams.

OpenEBS is a 100% Open Source CNCF project made with heart by MayaData & the community. Prominent users include Arista, Optoro, Orange, Comcast and the CNCF itself.
