title: Managing Linux in Real Time with SaltStack | Rawkode Live
youtubeId: E6LoyB1l8QQ
---

In this episode, joined by my colleague Edward Vielmetti, we go through the installation and configuration of a SaltStack cluster for managing a heterogeneous collection of systems.


SaltStack (often referred to as just Salt) is Python-based, open-source software for event-driven IT automation, remote task execution, and configuration management. Supporting the "Infrastructure as Code" approach to data center system and network deployment and management, configuration automation, SecOps orchestration, vulnerability remediation, and hybrid cloud control.
