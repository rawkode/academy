title: Building Custom Images for Packet (RTFM with Rawkode)
youtubeId: IWt_uHk9dMg
---

In this episode, I attempt (and kind of succeed) at building a custom OS image for deployment on Packet.

In the end, the custom image didn't work. It turned out that this was an error on the Packet side, and not mine! Following these steps now should work 😀

💁🏻‍♂️    Want some help?
