In this episode, joined by Ciaran McNulty & Alex Bowers, we take a look at the best practices for developing Laravel PHP applications with Docker, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes.

Our focus is on PHP applications run with nginx and php-fpm. This episode is a follow up to my "Kickass Development Environments with Docker" talk that I gave from 2016-2018.

Dubbed "The PHP Framework for Web Artisan", Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We’ve already laid the foundation — freeing you to create without sweating the small things.
