In this episode, joined by Ciaran McNulty, we take a look at the best practices for developing Laravel PHP applications with Docker, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes.

Our focus is on PHP applications run with nginx and php-fpm. This episode is a follow up to my "Kickass Development Environments with Docker" talk that I gave from 2016-2018.

Dubbed "The PHP Framework for Web Artisan", Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We’ve already laid the foundation — freeing you to create without sweating the small things.

01:50 - Context / Background: What are we going to do?
11:00 - Looking at the development environment we provided last time
12:00 - Docker for Mac volume options for better performance
22:00 - Making asset / nodejs asset compilation a better experience for local development


Note: We spent a lot of time working with explicit volume mounts to make the Laravel mix process work. It turns out that mix uses the location / existence of. The artisan file to establish the document root for asset compilation. The debugging around this should still be useful 😬
