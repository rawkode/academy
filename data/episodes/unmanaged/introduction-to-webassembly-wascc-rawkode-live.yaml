WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

waSCC, WebAssembly Secure Capabilities Connector, is a WebAssembly host runtime that dynamically and securely binds WebAssembly modules to capability providers. These provider plug-ins provide abstractions around and connectivity to cloud-native servicesâ€”message brokers, databases, HTTPâ€”or they can expose special-purpose capabilities like IoT, embedded hardware, and more.
