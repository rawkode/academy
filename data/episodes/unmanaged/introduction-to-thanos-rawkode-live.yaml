Bartek Plotka is a Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat with a background in SRE, currently working on OpenShift Observability.

Thanos is a set of components that can be composed into a highly available metric system with unlimited storage capacity, which can be added seamlessly on top of existing Prometheus deployments.

Thanos is a CNCF Incubating project.

Thanos leverages the Prometheus 2.0 storage format to cost-efficiently store historical metric data in any object storage while retaining fast query latencies. Additionally, it provides a global query view across all Prometheus installations and can merge data from Prometheus HA pairs on the fly.

Concretely the aims of the project are:

- Global query view of metrics.
- Unlimited retention of metrics.
- High availability of components, including Prometheus.
