🔨 About the Technologies

vcluster

vcluster - Virtual Clusters For Kubernetes
    Lightweight & Low-Overhead - Based on k3s, bundled in a single pod and with super-low resource consumption
    No Performance Degradation - Pod are scheduled in the underlying host cluster, so they get no performance hit at all while running
    Reduced Overhead On Host Cluster - Split up large multi-tenant clusters into smaller vcluster to reduce complexity and increase scalability
    Flexible & Easy Provisioning - Create via vcluster CLI, helm, kubectl, Argo any of your favorite tools (it is basically just a StatefulSet)
    No Admin Privileges Required - If you can deploy a web app to a Kubernetes namespace, you will be able to deploy a vcluster as well
    Single Namespace Encapsulation - Every vcluster and all of its workloads are inside a single namespace of the underlying host cluster
    Easy Cleanup - Delete the host namespace and the vcluster plus all of its workloads will be gone immediately
