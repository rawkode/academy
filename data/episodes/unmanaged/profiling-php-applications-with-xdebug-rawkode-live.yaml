In this episode, joined by Derick Rethans, we take a look at Xdebug and how it help you profile your PHP applications, allowing you to use a profiling front-end, like qcachegrind, to visualise your call graphs and dig into the bottlenecks of your applications.

- It upgrades PHP's var_dump() function
- It adds stack traces for Notices, Warnings, Errors and Exceptions

- It contains a profiler
- It provides code coverage functionality for use with PHPUnit
